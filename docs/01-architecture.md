# 01 — Architecture

## Shape

One process, one binary, no Node/Bun on the hot path. Optional sidecars only
where the ecosystem forces it (MCP stdio servers, LSP servers, JS plugins).

Sidecars (each optional, each with its own lifecycle and RAM budget):

| Sidecar | When | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| MCP stdio servers | user config | stdin/stdout JSON-RPC |
| LSP servers | first file of a language | stdin/stdout JSON-RPC |
| JS plugin host (Bun) | any JS plugin configured | stdin/stdout JSON-RPC |
| `oc-pty` daemon | terminal feature used | named pipe, upstream frame protocol |

## Crates

| Crate | Responsibility | Must not depend on |
|---|---|---|
| `oc-types` | Wire types, IDs, events, errors, config types, JSON helpers | everything else |
| `oc-store` | SQLite schema, migrations, repositories, event log, inbox | runtime/server |
| `oc-config` | Discovery, merge/precedence, permissions, credentials | runtime/server |
| `oc-llm` | Provider registry, models.dev catalog, streaming, retries, token estimate | tools/store |
| `oc-antigravity` | Antigravity Google OAuth, multi-account pool, Cloud Code Assist gateway, transforms, quota & grounding search | runtime internals/server |
| `oc-runtime` | Session actors, turn loop, prompt assembly, compaction, instructions | server/UI |
| `oc-tools` | Tool registry, built-ins, lanes, subagent/session/memory/goal tools | server |
| `oc-observer` | Expectation registry, observer actor, goal judge, repair executor | server |
| `oc-memory` | Memory store, FTS retrieval, scribe | server |
| `oc-mcp` | MCP client, transports, OAuth, tool mapping | server |
| `oc-lsp` | LSP client manager, diagnostics cache, tools | server |
| `oc-plugin` | Native plugin host + JS sidecar bridge, transforms/hooks | server |
| `oc-pty` | Port of upstream `packages/process-daemon` (Rust already) | server |
| `oc-server` | axum routes, middleware, SSE/WS, static assets, OpenAPI | runtime internals |
| `oc-cli` | `opencode serve|run|auth|models|session|…` | — |
| `oc-testkit` | Golden fixtures, harness, fault injection | — |

`oc-server` talks to `oc-runtime` through a command enum and a query trait; no
handler reaches into a repository directly. This keeps the HTTP layer testable
without a live model.

## Concurrency model

- **One `SessionActor` per session**, owning that session's turn state. It is
  created lazily and parked after idle. Commands: `Prompt`, `Synthetic`,
  `Interrupt`, `SetAgent`, `SetModel`, `Compact`, `WritePeer`, `Repair`,
  `Shutdown`.
- **Inbox is durable.** A prompt is written to `session_inbox` and published
  before the actor is woken. Crash between write and wake is recoverable.
- **Tool calls run concurrently** in a `JoinSet`, each with a cancellation token
  and an expectation id. A tool result is committed exactly once (`tool_call`
  row state machine: `pending → running → ok|error|cancelled`).
- **Single SQLite writer.** A dedicated writer task owns the write connection
  and batches commits per turn step. Reads use an `r2d2` pool (WAL). No async
  task holds a connection across an `.await` that can block on a model.
- **Event bus** is a `tokio::sync::broadcast` of `Arc<EventFrame>`; each frame
  is serialized **once** to `Bytes` and fanned out. Per-subscriber bounded queue
  (4096); overflow closes that subscriber with the upstream error, never blocks
  the producer.
- **Observer** is a separate actor per root session, never inline in the turn
  loop. It can only act through the same command API as everything else.

## Turn data flow

1. `POST /api/session/:id/prompt` → validate → `oc-store` insert inbox row →
   publish `session.inbox.enqueued` → notify actor.
2. Actor promotes inbox → loads context → composes instructions → calls
   `oc-llm`.
3. LLM stream events are mapped to protocol events, persisted as they finish
   (not per delta), and published to the bus.
4. Tool calls get the `expectation` argument stripped, are authorized, then run
   concurrently; each start/settle updates the expectation registry and the
   observer.
5. Step ends → compaction check → continue if tools ran → settle execution
   (a step-budget exhaustion settles `succeeded`, then publishes
   `session.execution.step_limit`).
6. All durable writes are committed before the terminal event is published.

## Key decisions and why

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-written serde types, OpenAPI as oracle | Effect encoding semantics (`absent ≠ null`, branded IDs, flat event unions) do not map cleanly to codegen; generated types would be enormous and slow to deserialize | manual upkeep, guarded by golden fixtures |
| `axum` + `hyper` | boring, HTTP/1+2, first-class SSE/WS upgrade | hand-rolled SSE envelope |
| `rusqlite` (bundled) + writer actor | no system SQLite dependency on Windows, predictable latency, no async SQL compile times | manual async bridging |
| `reqwest` + hand-rolled SSE parser | control over provider headers, retries, timeouts, byte-level streaming | provider protocol work |
| JS plugins via sidecar | full compatibility with upstream Effect plugins is impossible in-process; sidecar is the only honest route | +~60–90 MB only when plugins exist |
| No embeddings by default | RAM and startup wins; FTS5 covers most recall | semantic recall optional |
| `mimalloc` | lower fragmentation/RSS on long sessions | one more native dep |

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. A terminal session event (`execution.succeeded|failed|interrupted`) is only
   published after its durable state is committed.
2. A tool call is never executed twice for the same `tool_call_id` unless the
   observer explicitly retries it, and that retry is recorded.
3. Every LLM request can be cancelled; cancellation always runs the
   uninterruptible finalizer that settles the assistant message and tool rows.
4. No unbounded in-memory collection keyed by session, tool call, or event.
   Every cache has a documented cap.
5. Static UI and API share an origin; `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/openapi.json` are
   never served by the SPA fallback.
