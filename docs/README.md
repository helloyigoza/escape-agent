# opencode-rust — Documentation

This directory is the source of truth for the Rust server port. It is written
before code on purpose: the port is large, and every design decision below has a
named owner, an invariant, and an acceptance check.

Upstream reference: `../opencode` (opencode v2 rewrite — `packages/{schema,core,
protocol,server,client,app}`). The port targets the **server** surface that the
web client, CLI and TUI consume over HTTP/SSE/WebSocket. TUI rendering is out of
scope; the TUI must keep working against our server.

## Rules that apply to every doc

- Wire compatibility is defined by `../opencode/packages/protocol/openapi.json`
  and `../opencode/packages/client/src/promise/generated/types.ts`, **not** by
  this prose. When they disagree, the generated types win and this doc is fixed.
- Optional fields are omitted, never `null` (Effect `optional()` semantics).
- IDs are prefixed strings (`ses_`, `msg_`, `evt_`, `prt_`, `req_`); IDs are
  opaque to clients and must never be re-derived except `evt_` → `msg_` for
  event-backed messages.
- No feature is "done" without a restart test: kill -9 the server mid-turn and
  verify recovery from durable state.
